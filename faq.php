                    <h3>Can I switch my investment between fund providers?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, your funds are not locked into any provider that we recommend. Devin Group LLC are constantly reviewing investment 
                        providers and their funds performance, we can help guide you with where your money will be working hardest for you.</p>

                    <h3>Can I earn more than a regular savings account or term-deposit?</h3>
                    <p>Currently with bank interest rates at historically low levels, you will find that the bank will not offer much on your 
                        savings or term-deposits. We have a large range of investment options that will likely see much higher returns enabling 
                        you to achieve regular income goals or retirement savings goals. Talk to us today to find out where we can make your money 
                        provide more favourable returns than the banks.</p>

                    <h3>How do I withdraw funds?</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the provider that your funds are invested in we can help you with the correct forms and liaise with the 
                        fund provider on your behalf once we have your signed instructions.</p>

                    <h3>How are my funds protected?</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the provider we end up investing your funds with, your funds are generally held in an independent custodial 
                        account operated by a third-party, who have been appointed to provide custody services to the particular provider. 
                        This ensures that there is complete separation of client assets from Devin Group LLC as a business. The custodial 
                        account is also made to ensure that all assets, including the bank accounts, are ring-fenced from the particular 
                        custodian’s business. The custodians monitor the investments made ensuring they are consistent with what investors 
                        should expect. The custodians are usually audited annually along with reporting required by the FMA.</p>

                    <h3>What’s the risk of investing?</h3>
                    <p>All investment carries risk, there is a risk that the returns may not meet expectations, or you may incur some short-term 
                        losses or even loss of capital. Some level of risk must be accepted in order to achieve your goals. At Devin Group LLC we 
                        will help you assess the level of risk you are prepared to take and invest your money accordingly. To find out more click

                        Due to the AML/CFT act we are required to ask for information relating to the “source of wealth” for trusts.  Usually this might be things like 
                        payslips, financial accounts for a business the trust owns, evidence of property or business sales or possibly inheritance details.</p>
